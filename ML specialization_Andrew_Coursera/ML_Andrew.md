# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
## Introduction to Machine Learning
### Application of Machine learning
Introduce the application of machine learning - the catogories of machine learning 

- Supervised learning([Course 1](https://github.com/Linsen-gao-457/Booking_reading-notes/tree/main/ML/MLS%20Slides/MLS_C1_PDFs) and [Course 2](https://github.com/Linsen-gao-457/Booking_reading-notes/tree/main/ML/MLS%20Slides/MLS_C2_PDFs))
- Unsupervised learning([Course 3](https://github.com/Linsen-gao-457/Booking_reading-notes/tree/main/ML/MLS%20Slides/MLS_C3_PDFs))
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

### Supervised Learning 

What's Supervised learning -> Catogories of supervised learning

There are two catogories of supervised learning
- Regression
- Classification

### Unsupervised Learning
Introduce what's unsupervised learning - What's Cluster - Unsupervised learning algorithm

Catogories of machine learning
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly detection

## Regression Model
### Linear Regression Model
Definition of Regression(continuous or discrete numbers(Classification)) - Notion of (x, y), $(x^{i}, y^{i})$ and $\hat {y}$
